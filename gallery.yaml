  Our project is an interactive RSA file encryption system. It supports 
  inputs that are text files. The user is able to choose to encrypt 
  and decrypt files using the RSA algorithm. This ensures that the contents 
  of the user's file are safely handled. Our project also includes an 
  easy-to-use interface via the terminal where the user can choose the file 
  to be encrypted/decrypted.
